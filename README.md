### Installation
This game is optimized to run in Mac computers **and** 
using the [**iTerm2**](https://iterm2.com/) terminal. 
- You need to access the 'src' folder by using 
``cd folderName/folderName/...`` until you find yourself inside the src folder.
- Once in 'src', in order to properly compile the code, 
you must run the command 
``src % javac com/ironhack/RPG/Main.java``
- Finally, run the program using ``src % java com/ironhack/RPG/Main``.
<br/>

If you are not able to run this program in Mac with the 
iTerm2 terminal, the next best option is to run it 
on the Intellij terminal. It will ignore some of the 
console-text colors, ignore some emojis, and break the 
alignment of some of the ASCII graphics... but it will 
run properly, which will not happen in a normal Windows 
terminal nor in a PowerShell.

### General Usage 
- You will be asked to create parties (teams) for your
  battles
    - You may create parties manually, automatically
      (random generator), or by uploading a csv file.
- You will be able to create Warrior or Wizard players
- Once the parties and their players are created, the
  battle will start.
- Battles take place in rounds.
    - Before each round, you will be asked to choose a
      combatant from each party.
    - The selected players will fight until one or both
      are dead.
    - You will then select the next couple of fighters
    - This process will go on until one of the parties
      is left without any alive players. At this point,
      a winner will be declared.

#### During the game
- You will be prompted in screen to input information
  (for the manual creation of players and parties; for
  the selection of players before each round).
- In your console/terminal, introduce your response and
  hit 'Intro'/'Enter'
- For the manual creation of players and parties you
  will be asked to input names (text) and properties
  (numbers).
- The rest of interactions will prompt you to select an
  option... you must do so by inputting the number/index
  related to your choice, NOT by writing the name of
  choice itself.
### History 
In a universe existing amidst a dense
mesh of silicon atoms, after aeons of normalcy and routine
execution of logical operations,
it's inhabitants finally discovered the possibility of
doing something besides work.

They gathered in an unused corner of their Condensed
Possibilities Universe and started to tell tales about
fictional warriors and wizards engaging in amazing battles.

Soon, this merely narrative after-office activity
became dull. The CPUnians needed more. The started crafting
armors, weapons, suits and wands. Many learned to
fight and cast spells.

Well, you know... time goes by, things get a bit out hand,
someone makes a drunken proposal, someone replies
"you don't have the balls to do that" and...

... now they meet to fight 'till death!!

Ok, either that, or we had to do this as a group project
for our IronHack Java Bootcamp... we'll never know.
